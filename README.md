In this assignment you are asked to create classes to implement a student account manager.
The assignment has two parts. In part one, define two classes: a person class that holds
the name, ID and array of student grades (in a course); a class list, whose objects can
hold any number of person objects, and via a public interface, add, delete, output, search
for and sort student objects by their IDs. Write a method that can automatically generate
any number (inputted by a user) of person objects and add them to a list object. The
information about a student can be arbitrary and meaningless (for now). An example of a
person object is: Annmd Kjsuusa, 245075533, [3.2,3.4,2,0,1,2,1]). You are free to include
any number of necessary (private) member functions for any of the classes if you think
they are needed. Naturally, you will need a main() function. In part two, implement a
testing algorithm in the main function to convince the marker that your program is working
correctly: enter 20,000 students into an empty list, generate output, manipulate the list, and
generate some output again. Usually a random sampling of link elements would do the job.
